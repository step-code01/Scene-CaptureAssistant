# Scene-Aware Capture Assistant (Showcase Only)

⚠️ This repository is a stripped-down **showcase module** for demonstration and educational purposes only.

## Overview

This project involves building a lightweight on-device assistant that analyzes live visual scenes for live scene photo and video capture understanding.
The current modules showcased here demonstrate isolated aspects of the system's visual processing capabilities and do **not** represent the full logic or pipeline.

## What This Repo Contains:

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Signal Extractors | Modular scripts that analyze basic perceptual and spatial features |
| Example Visual Inputs | Synthetic or placeholder images to demonstrate pipeline behavior |
| Visualization Utilities | Tools to visualize outputs (for educational illustration only) |

These components reflect **general-purpose, educational examples** and all task-specific models, system intelligence, or proprietary heuristics are private.

## Tech Stack Used (in this demo)

- Python 3.9+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Note: Core project components, on-device logic, and learning-based models are **not included in this repository**.

## ⚠️ Intellectual Property & Usage

This repository is intended **solely for portfolio and educational showcase**. It omits critical code, models, and pipelines that are part of the full system.

Please **do not copy, reuse, or rehost** any component without written permission.
